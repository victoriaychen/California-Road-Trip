# California Road Trip

Contributors: Sara Siqueira, Sally Song, Jason Xiang, Victoria Chen

California Road Trip is a web app that help people plan their perfect California road trip. Users can save/unsave one of the 6 California cities to the Your Trip page. 

For the front-end, we used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and Jquery. For the back-end, we used My SQL, PHP, 4 APIs (weather, sunrise/sunset, AQI, map). 
Our web app is hosted on Infinity Free. 

This is our final project for COMP 20 Web Programming.
